I'm not interested in maintaining this project and I have not been in a while. Try [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord) or [DiscordKt](https://github.com/DiscordKt/DiscordKt).

# KDA
A Kotlin library to interface with JDA and increase code readability and cleanliness.

Adding KDA as a Gradle dependency:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'maven'

repositories {
    // Add jcenter and other repositories as needed
    maven { url 'http://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.ThatsNoMoon:KDA:master-SNAPSHOT'
    // Add JDA and other dependencies as needed
}
```

Take a look at the [Examples Page!](https://github.com/ThatsNoMoon/KDA/wiki/Examples)
